/*

Remember, only one radio button should be able to be 
chosen. 
Otherwise checkboxes (for which you can pick more than 
one) would be used. Then a  message will appear about 
their choice. 

Requirements
Name all controls, using 3 letter acronyms for first
three letters. 
Only appStudio controls can be used in the app 
for interaction with the user, I & O (Input and Output). 
  No alerts, popups, prompts, etc. 

Add event handler code  that shows a message in a 
label control in this format: 
I would agree that you are a 'trusting' person too!
Add a button on the right bottom corner of the form 
that, when clicked, goes to the next page - 
the favExercises page.
